# **codeWars Solutions in Go**

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) implemented in the Go programming language.

## About CodeWars

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) is a platform where developers can practice coding skills through programming challenges called kata. Each kata is a small coding exercise that can be solved within a limited time frame using a specific programming language.

## Why Go?

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. It offers powerful features such as goroutines for concurrency, a strong standard library, and a clean syntax, making it an excellent choice for solving coding challenges.
